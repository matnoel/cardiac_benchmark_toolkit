# Cardiac Benchmark Toolkit

This repository contains basic scripts that allow you to reproduce the mesh and fibers in the cardiac mechanics benchmark in dolfin.

Moreover, it provides the data to recreate all the comparison curves seen in the article. *[The results section](#Results)* shows how to reproduce the plots.

*For the [dolfinx](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx) implementation, [check here](https://github.com/Reidmen/cardiac_benchmark_toolkitx)*

## Installation

**Docker** (Recommended)
Run the following command to start a container with all the required dependencies:

```shell
docker run --name dolfin-stable -v $(pwd):/home/shared -w /home/shared -ti ghcr.io/scientificcomputing/fenics-gmsh:2023-04-21
```

In order to enter the shell, use:

```shell
docker exec -ti dolfin-stable /bin/bash -l
```

**Note** docker image is courtesy of *Simula Lab*.

### Local Installation

If your system has already `fenics` version `2019.1.0.post0`, you can install this package typing:

```shell
pip3 install .
```

## Quickstart

To have an overview of the options available through this package, execute it your terminal

```shell
cardiac-benchmark-toolkit --help
```
It the installation was succesfull you should be prompted with the following:
![prompt-help](figs/toolkit_main_options.png)

## Mesh Generation

### Ellipsoid domain
The ellipsoid domain can be created with a characteristic element size (default is `0.005 [m]`) using the
script `mesh_generation.py`. It will create a folder structure `./results` to stores `xdmf` as well as `pvd` formats
for further usage.

To execute it, consider the following command:
```shell
cardiac-benchmark-toolkit create-ellipsoid --char-length 0.007
```

Its command details can be seen with:
```
cardiac-benchmark-toolkit create-ellipsoid --help
```
![prompt-ellipsoid-help](figs/toolkit_ellipsoid_options.png)

It will create an ellipsoid mesh with characteristic element size of `0.007 [m]`. You can use it in conjuntion with the
`ellipsoid_fiber_generation` to create the fiber directions for your specific simulation (and benchmark).

Examples of mesh at two different element sizes can be seen below:
![comparison-meshes](figs/comparison_meshes.png)

### Biventricular domain
The biventricular domain is provided in the `./data/` including source files in `vtk`, `pvd` for fine and coarse sizes.
Example of a fine geometry is depicted below:

### Ellipsoid Fiber Generation
This repository provides a tagged ellipsoid geometry for reference purposes in the folder `./data/monoventricle_mesh/`.
Using the mesh `./monoventricle_mesh/ellipsoid_0.005.xdmf`, you can create the fibers as follows:

```shell
cardiac-benchmark-toolkit create-fibers-for-ellipsoid-mesh ./monoventricle_mesh/ellipsoid_0.005.xdmf
```

If succesfull, the script will create fibers in `xdmf` and `vtk` files in a `./results/` folder.

Further options can be found with:

```shell
cardiac-benchmark-toolkit create-fibers-for-ellipsoid-mesh --help
```

### Biventricular Fiber Generation (LifeX -> FEniCS)
Reference fibers created using the [lifex](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-023-05260-w)
can be found in the subfolder in `./data/` as `fiber_biv.vtk`. This repository includes options to
generate FEniCS-compatible `h5` format for fiber directions.

To crate fibers for the fine mesh in P2, run in your shell:
```shell
cardiac-benchmark-toolkit create-biv-domain-from-mesh-and-fibers data/biv_mesh_and_fibers_fine_p2/ --element_degree 2
```

The command line above will create fiber, sheet and sheet-normal directions from the `vtk` source files in `./data/biv_mesh_and_fibers_fine_p2`.

Depicted below are fiber (left) and sheet (right) directions created from this procedure.

## Results 

In order to recreate the comparison curves seen in all blinded and non-blinded phases, run:

```bash
cd results && python3 results/figures.py 
```

The comparison results will be found in the `./results` directory.
